## Background and Significance
Artificial Intelligence (AI) has revolutionized industries by enabling machines to simulate human intelligence, making complex decisions, and efficiently processing data. As AI continues to grow in prominence, understanding its principles is essential for students and professionals alike.

Interactive visual simulations have been shown to enhance the learning experience by providing users with tangible ways to experiment with systems and observe outcomes. According to research by Mouhib Alnoukari et al., such simulations help students better grasp technical content and improve their problem-solving accuracy.

This project proposes an interactive AI learning playground where users can explore AI concepts, data structures, and algorithms through visual simulations. The platform aims to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application.
