  "quiz1Title": "Enhance Chest X-ray",
  "quiz1Description": "Adjust the contrast to improve the visibility of lung structures in this chest X-ray.",
  "quiz1Hint": "Try increasing the contrast to make the lung structures more visible against the background.",
  
  "quiz2Title": "Brighten Dark MRI",
  "quiz2Description": "Increase the brightness to reveal details in this underexposed brain MRI.",
  "quiz2Hint": "Increasing brightness will help reveal details in the darker regions of the image.",
  
  "quiz3Title": "Adjust Gamma in CT Scan",
  "quiz3Description": "Modify the gamma correction to enhance the visibility of soft tissues in this abdominal CT scan.",
  "quiz3Hint": "Gamma correction can help balance the midtones without affecting the darkest and brightest parts too much.",
  
  "quiz4Title": "Equalize Histogram in Ultrasound",
  "quiz4Description": "Apply histogram equalization to improve the contrast in this ultrasound image.",
  "quiz4Hint": "Histogram equalization redistributes intensity values to improve overall contrast in images with poor contrast.",
  
  "quiz5Title": "Apply Smoothing to Noisy Image",
  "quiz5Description": "Use a smoothing filter to reduce noise in this medical image while preserving important details.",
